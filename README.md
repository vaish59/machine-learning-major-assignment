# ML Major Assignment: Oil Spill Detection

This repository contains my Machine Learning major assignment project.  
The project focuses on building a predictive model using oil spill dataset.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `best_model.pkl` - Trained and saved ML model.
- `ML assignment.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with full code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `Major Assignment ML.html` - Exported HTML version of the notebook.
- `oil_spill.xlsx` - Dataset used for training/testing the model.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "ML assignment.ipynb"
    ```

## 📈 Model

- Built using **scikit-learn**.
- Includes data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.
- Final model is saved as a `.pkl` file (`best_model.pkl`).

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset `oil_spill.xlsx` contains features related to oil spill detection.
- Preprocessing steps like missing value treatment, feature selection, etc., are applied before model training.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
